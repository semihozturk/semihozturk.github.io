* This is a survey project for a fictional course
* I made a form, with inputs as text, email, number, radio, checkbox
* Added button, textarea, and a menu to select
* Used placeholder, and required properties for text, and email inputs. Disabled selected value for selectable menu
* Used css to style my html. Like adding actions when button:hover, and selected some properties for inputs for whichever I want (like all inputs, except radio, and checkbox)
* Made labels one under the other, making them as a block element
